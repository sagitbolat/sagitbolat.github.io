    <h2>Writing a Game Engine Part II: Platform Layer</h2>

    As I mentioned in the <a href="#post-2">previous post</a>, I used <a href="https://guide.handmadehero.org/">Handmade Hero</a> as a starting point
    for writing the platform layer for my engine. It is a really great resource that I cannot recommend more highly.
    That said, I did have some problems with implementation in the series. I wasn't the biggest fan of using the Win32 API, because I wanted
    to be able to work on Linux, and that meant writing two Platform Layers up-front, which is not something I intended on doing (perhaps in the
    future I will write an optimized platform layer for all three major OS's, but not for a while). My solution was to use the SDL library to
    do the cross-platform heavy lifting for me. I was able to isolate the SDL code from the rest of my codebase, so if I want to swap out SDL 
    for Win32, for example, in the future, it will be as easy as writing a Win32 platform layer and replacing the file in the build path.

    In this article I will walk through how the platform layer is structured.
