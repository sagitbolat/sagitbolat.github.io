                                <p class="project-par">The original Piet specification identifies a set of 18 colors to represent instructions. This project is an interpreter
                                that allows the user to provide a custom color scheme to program with. This color scheme is provided in PNG format, with 18 pixels of different
                                colors.</p>

                                        <li class="project-par"><b id="hl">The Tokenizer:</b> The tokenizer parses the image. Adjacent pixels of the same color form a data value
                                        (the value is equal to the number of adjacent pixels) and stores that value on the stack. The parser then goes to the next adjacent pixel block.
                                        The color transition determines the operation. These operations are stored as tokens. The tokenizer uses the <b id="hl">OpenCV</b> library
                                        for reading image files.</li>

                                        by the Parser, data is removed from the stack (and sometimes written back in in post-processed form). The stack acts as the primary and only
                                        type of memory allocation in the language. There is no heap allocation, as all data is numeric. The piet language can only do calculations
                                        and output those calculations to the console, so all data is stored as chars. Data can be outputted in numeric or string format.</li>
                                        <li class="project-par"><b id='hl'>The Parser:</b> The parser takes a list of tokens and runs apropriate functions on the data in the stack based on the 
                                        tokens parsed. Some operations are done on the previously stored value, while others are done on the previously stored
                                        and the next read value. </li>

                                    <b>The features of the application are as follows:</b>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li class="project-par"><b id="hl">Simple Puzzle Generation</b>: The generation algorithm first uses a backtracking approach to generate a full
                                        number grid that satisfies the sudoku puzzle constraints. In order to improve the backtracking efficiency, every time a number is used, it is
                                        removed from the possible choices for squares in the same row, column, or 3x3 square. This process is done for every cell in the grid. 
                                        Once a fully filled grid is generated, numbers are removed at random, until a Sudoku puzzle of a specified difficulty is formed.</li>
                                        <li class="project-par"><b id="hl">Guaranteed Single-Solution Generation:</b> When a puzzle is generated in the process as described above, it
                                        is possible for the resulting puzzle to have more than one unique solution. A good sudoku puzzle must have only a single solution, so the player
                                        can avoid having to guess numbers at random. This generator has the option of guaranteeing a puzzle to have a unique solution. In order to do that,
                                        every time a number is removed from the grid, the Solver algorithm is applied on the puzzle. If the solver finds more than one solution, the number
                                        is replaced, and a different number is removed. After a certain number of failed attempts, the generator stops, to avoid infinite loops.</li>
                                        <li class="project-par"><b id="hl">Sudoku Solver:</b> Much like the generation algorithm uses backtracking in order to solve the puzzle.</li>

                                        This allows the user to more clearly see the execution step by step.</li>
                                        <li class="project-par"><b id="hl">User Solution: </b>The user is able to attempt to solve the puzzle themselves. This makes the application an 
                                        essentially complete Sudoku game client. The user can use the keyboard "WASD" or arrow keys to navigate the grid and use the number keys to input numbers.
                                        To erase previously inputted numbers, the user can use the "0" number. The user is unable to change or erase the numbers generated by the grid</li>

                                <h4>1. Intro</h4>
                                <p>
                                    I have long wanted to start some form of a devlog, whether it be in written or video form. 
                                    At first I thought of video devlogs to be the perfect format. You simply talk into a microphone and 
                                    show off whatever project you have been working on at the time. However, as I quickly found out, videos take a long time
                                    to prepare the right footage for, edit, and bring a whole slew of complications. This is why I decided to create a devlog in
                                    written form instead. I had already been working on a personal website to put on my CV, and using the same site to host a
                                    devlog seems like an efficient use of time. As to why I created this blog, I wanted (and perhaps needed) a medium to express
                                    my thoughts and keep them organized. I hope that that the thoughts that are about either whatever I am working on at the time, or
                                    random invasive thoughts I might have that I cannot share with anyone in the real world can find their place in this blog.
                                </p>
                                <h4>
                                    2. So what does the title have to do with anything?
                                </h4>
                                <p>
                                    The other day (and by that I mean last night), I was watching <a href="https://youtu.be/_NmfCLssHuI?t=2331">a Q&A</a> from 
                                    an event called <a href="https://handmade.network/conferences">Handmade Con</a> which is based on a project by Casey Muratori: 
                                    <a href="https://handmadehero.org/">Handmade Hero</a>. 
                                    Those that have attempted to create video games from scratch for the first time in recent years are probably familiar with 
                                    the project to some degree. In the Q&A, a question was asked about the advice that the panelists would give themselves at the start
                                    of their careers. Jonathan Blow's (the guy closest to Casey on the panel) answer to that question essetially boils down to "Listen to
                                    the voice in your head that tells you that you might be doing something wrong."
                                </p>
                                <h4>3. Dunning-Kruger Effect vs Impostor Syndrome</h4>
                                <p>
                                    At first glance that answer seems to be au contraire to the 
                                    <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/childhood-emotional-neglect/202206/self-doubt-is-corrosive-how-address-its-root-cause">
                                        common notion that self doubt is bad for you
                                    </a>. However, this got me thinking about the conceptuality of Impostor Syndrome and the 
                                    Dunning-Kruger Effect and how they relate to the work we do as programmers
                                    as well as to eachother. These two are very common in the programming industry (as in every industry, probably), and yet people seem to
                                    treat them as mutually-exclusive (and why wouldn't they be, they are completely opposite of eachother!). However, thinking about these two 
                                    states of mind as two sided of the same coin seems to complicate the problem. What if one comes to a realization that they are experiencing
                                    impostor syndrome, and work diligently to correct themselves, while in reality, they <b>think</b> they have impostor syndrome while in reality,
                                    the work they are doing is as bad as it seems. So by trying to combat their impostor syndrome, they are digging themselves deeper into the 
                                    Dunning-Kruger hole. Of course, the inverse might also be true.
                                </p> 
                                <h4>4. So how do I know which of these I am?</h4>
                                <p>
                                    The first obvious solution is to ask for feedback. Clearly, we are not good judges of our own work, and so we must recruit
                                    and outside observer to tell us if what we are doing is as <b>good</b> or as <b>bad</b> as we think it is.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    However, not all feedback is created equal, and it is the job of the one who recieves it to parse it in the appropriate manner.
                                    Some feedback might not be inherintely useful by itself, but instead give you a push to arrive at a conclusion you might have otherwise
                                    missed entirely. And, by the same logical line, some feedback is completely useless.

                                    So, how can we know which feedback is useful, which is insightful, and which is completely garbage? Do we not fall into the same issues 
                                    as the ones we started with? If we dont know whether the feedback we get is reliable, and we cannot trust ourselves to be objective, how
                                    then must we determine the quality of our work?

                                    I don't have them. My approach has been to assume I am doing a job of some quality that is somewhere between the extremas of being the 
                                    greatest thing to have even been created by anyone ever, and being the thing that will eventually cause the collapse of our civilization
                                    through the shear power of it's own atrociousness.

                                    In reality, most things that most people work on land on a much tighter spectrum. Right between "great" and "terrible". Right on the "average".
                                    Statistically, chances are the quality of your work is not bad, but neither is it good. This might sound depressing, but it opens an opportunity.
                                    If what you have now is not bad, but is comparable to the vast majority of projects of similar scales that exist in the void of ideas (whether 
                                    these ideas have been executed on or not), then you have the opportunity to improve on your ideas day after day. If you start with something average,
                                    and you sculpt it to become better every day, eventually it will become good. Then, you keep working on it, and eventually it might become great.
                                    Given enough time.

                                <p>
                                    Regardless of whether you think what you are doing is good, or what you are doing is bad, the only real way forward is to iterate on
                                    what you have now and improve it. There is no downside to improvement regardless of whether you are experiencing the Dunning-Kruger
                                    Effect or Impostor Syndrome. The only danger comes from letting one of these stifle your progress, either by letting yourself believe that
                                    you can never fail, or making yourself believe that you will never succeed.
